### âœ… Final Steps

1. Export your n8n workflow as `workflow.json`
2. Take a screenshot of the full flow (or export it) as `workflow-diagram.png`
3. Create the GitHub repo and upload these files
4. Add your README.md
5. Optional: Add a LICENSE (MIT is a good default)

Want me to generate the full `README.md` file and give it to you directly to upload?
